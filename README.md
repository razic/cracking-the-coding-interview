# Cracking the Coding Interview

> This repository contains the solutions to the interview questions in the
> amazing book: "Cracking the Coding Interview", by Gayle Lakkmann McDowell.

## Why is this here?

The book encourages readers to physically write out their solutions on paper,
and then type it in "word for word" on a computer, taking note of all problems
encountered getting it working.

These are my solutions, written in Golang. I hope to come back and look at
various solutions and their implementations when I need a refresher.
