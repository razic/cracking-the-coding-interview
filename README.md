# Cracking the Coding Interview

> This repository contains the solutions to the interview questions in the
> amazing book: "Cracking the Coding Interview", by Gayle Lakkmann McDowell.

## Why is this here?

The book encourages readers to physically write out their solutions on paper,
and then type it in, "word for word", nhen write down all of the problems
encountered trying to get it working.

These are my solutions, written in Golang. I hope to come back and look at
various solutions and their implementations when I need a refresher.
